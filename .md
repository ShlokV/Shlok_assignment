Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code pertains to the punishment for murder. If a hit-and-run case leads to a murder charge under IPC Section 302, it would generally imply that the act was done with the intention to cause death or that the perpetrator knew that such an act was likely to result in death.\n\nHowever, typical hit-and-run cases, where there wasn't an intention to kill, would usually not fall under Section 302, but rather under Sections related to culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304), causing death by negligence (Section 304A), or related provisions under the Motor Vehicles Act.\n\nNevertheless, here are some general points to consider when looking for case law on this matter:\n\n1. **Legal Precedents**: For section 302 in hit-and-run scenarios, look for cases where the act was identified as having a murderous intent, rare as it may be.\n   \n2. **Rationale**: Key rulings would revolve around the intent of the perpetrator, the manner of the accident, and the recklessness of the behavior leading to the accident.\n\n3. **Supreme Court and High Court Judgments**: The Supreme Court of India and High Courts often lead in setting the precedents. Checking their archives for landmark judgments would be illuminating.\n\n4. **Law Reports and Journals**: Legal databases like SCC Online, Manupatra, or Indian Kanoon provide extensive case laws covering a broad range of legal issues including judgments pertaining to Section 302 IPC.\n\n5. **Law Libraries**: Traditional law libraries have volumes of reported judgments which can be referred to for understanding how the law has evolved in this context.\n\n6. **Legal Commentaries**: Referencing academic commentaries, textbooks, and journals on the subject may provide insight into how section 302 has been applied in various circumstances, including cases that involve vehicular accidents with an element that elevates it to murder.\n\nIf specific cases are requested, it would require legal research using the aforementioned resources or databases, which typically contain extensive law reports and are used by legal professionals to find relevant case law.
